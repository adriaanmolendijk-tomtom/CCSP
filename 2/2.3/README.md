# 2.3 - Design and apply data security technologies and strategies

## Encryption and Key Management

- Storage-level encryption
- Volume-level encryption
- Object-level encryption
- File-level encryption
- Application-level encryption
- Database-level encryption

## Hashing

Hash function

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)

> A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, though there are some hash functions that support variable length output.

## Data Obfuscation

Data obfuscation

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_masking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_masking)

> Data masking or data obfuscation is the process of modifying sensitive data in such a way that it is of no or little value to unauthorized intruders while still being usable by software or authorized personnel.

- Substitution
- Shuffling
- Value variance
- Deletion / nullification
- Encryption

Masking
> E.g. Daily HR users accessing bank account number see account number XXXX1234, limiting the amount of data displayed.

De-identification

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-identification)

> De-identification is the process used to prevent someone's personal identity from being revealed. For example, data produced during human subject research might be de-identified to preserve the privacy of research participants. Biological data may be de-identified in order to comply with HIPAA regulations that define and stipulate patient privacy laws.

Tokenization

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(data_security)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(data_security))

> Tokenization, when applied to data security, is the process of substituting a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent, referred to as a token, that has no intrinsic or exploitable meaning or value.

## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
