## Machine learning

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

> Machine learning (ML) is an umbrella term for solving problems for which development of algorithms by human programmers would be cost-prohibitive, and instead the problems are solved by helping machines "discover" their "own" algorithms, without needing to be explicitly told what to do by any human-developed algorithms.
