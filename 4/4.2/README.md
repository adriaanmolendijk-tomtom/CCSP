> The waterfall model is a breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases, meaning they are passed down onto each other, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialization of tasks.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
