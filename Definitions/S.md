## Serverless Computing

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing)

> Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers. "Serverless" is a misnomer in the sense that servers are still used by cloud service providers to execute code for developers.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement)

> A service-level agreement (SLA) is an agreement between a service provider and a customer. Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user.

## Single-Sign On (SSO)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on)

> Software as a service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. SaaS is also known as on-demand software, web-based software, or web-hosted software.

## Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_composition_analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_composition_analysis)

> It is a common software engineering practice to develop software by using different components.

## Software Defined Networking (SDN)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking)

> Software-defined networking (SDN) technology is an approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration to improve network performance and monitoring, in a manner more akin to cloud computing than to traditional network management.

## Statement of Work (SOW)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_of_work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_of_work)

> A statement of work (SOW) is a document routinely employed in the field of project management. It is the narrative description of a project's work requirement.

## Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing)

> Static application security testing (SAST) is used to secure software by reviewing the source code of the software to identify sources of vulnerabilities.

## STRIDE

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security))

> STRIDE is a model for identifying computer security threats developed by Praerit Garg and Loren Kohnfelder at Microsoft. It provides a mnemonic for security threats in six categories.

## Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_risk_management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_risk_management)

> Supply chain risk management (SCRM) is "the implementation of strategies to manage both everyday and exceptional risks along the supply chain based on continuous risk assessment with the objective of reducing vulnerability and ensuring continuity".
