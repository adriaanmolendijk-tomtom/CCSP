## Cloud Shared Considerations

Interopability
> The ability to communicate with and share data across multiple platforms and between traditional IT and cloud services by different vendors.

Portability
> Data portability - the ability to move data between traditional and cloud services or between different cloud services without having to port the data using potentially lossy methods.
> Architecture portability - the ability to allow migration of applications or systems without significant changes to or loss of service.

Reversibility
> The measure to which, when an organization moves an application or workload into a CSP, it can be moved back out again.
> This reverse could be one from CSP to another, or back to an on-premises environment.

Availability
> Ensure availability of the application / system, often to meet defined SLAs.

Resiliency
> The ability to continue operating under adverse or unexpected conditions.
