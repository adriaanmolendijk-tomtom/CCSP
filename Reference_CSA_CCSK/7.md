# Domain 7: Infrastructure Security

## Introduction

## Cloud network virtualization
- VLANs
- Software defined networking

SDN security benefits
- Isolation is easier
- SDN firewalls are more flexible

## Cloud compute and workload security

- Virtual machines
- Containers
- Platform based workloads
- Serverless computing

Immutable workloads
- No long patching running workloads
- Security testing happens during image creation

Security monitoring
- IP addresses are ephemeral, hence unique identifier for workloads is needed
- Logs need to be offloaded and centralized
