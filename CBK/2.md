# Domain 2: Cloud Data Security

## 2.1 - Describe Cloud Data Concepts

### Cloud data lifecycle phases

- Create
- Store
- Use
- Share
- Archive
- Destroy

### Data Dispersion

Data dispersion refers to a techniques of breaking data into smaller chunks and storing them across different physcial storage devices.

### Data Flows

Data flow diagrams can be used to gain visibility and ensure that adequate controls are implemented.

## 2.2 - Design and Implement Cloud Data Storage Architectures

### Storage Types

IaaS
- Ephemeral
- Raw
- Long term
- Volume
- Object

PaaS
- Disk
- Databases
- Binary large object (blob)

SaaS
- Information storage and management
- Content and file storage
- Content delivery network

### Threats to Storage Types

- Unauthorized access
- Unauthorized provisioning
- Regulatory noncompliance
- Jurisdictional issues
- Denial of service
- Data corruption or destruction
- Theft or media loss
- Malware and ransomware
- Improper disposal

## 2.3 - Design and Apply Data Security Technologies and Strategies

### Encryption and Key Management

- Storage-level encryption
- Volume-level encryption
- Object-level encryption
- File-level encryption
- Application-level encryption
- Database-level encryption

### Hashing

[Hash function](../Definitions/H.md#hash-function)

### Data Obfuscation

[Data obfuscation](../Definitions/D.md#data-obfuscation)

- Substitution
- Shuffling
- Value variance
- Deletion / nullification
- [Encryption](../Definitions/E.md#encryption)
- Masking
- [De-identification](../Definitions/D.md#de-identification)
- [Tokenization](../Definitions/T.md#tokenization)

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

- Discovery
- Monitoring
- At-rest
- In-use
- Enforcement

### Keys, Secrets and Certificates Management

- Keys
- Secrets
- Certificates

## 2.4 - Implement Data Discovery

- [Data lake](../Definitions/D.md#data-lake)
- [Data warehouse](../Definitions/D.md#data-warehouse)
- Data mart
- [Data mining](../Definitions/D.md#data-mining)
- Online analytic processing
- ML/AI training

### Structured Data

[Metadata](../Definitions/M.md#metadata)

### Unstructured Data

- Pattern matching
- Lexical analysis
- Hashing

### Semi-structured Data

- HTML
- XML
- JSON

### Data location

## 2.5 - Implement Data Classification

### Data Classification Policies

- Data type
- Legal constraints
- Ownership
- Value/criticality

Common sensitive data types
- [Personally identifiable information](../Definitions/P.md#personally-identifiable-information-pii)
- [Protected health information](../Definitions/P.md#protected-health-information)
- [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard](../Standards/PCI_DSS.md)

Handling sensitive data
- Compliance requirements inherent at various classification levels
- Data retention and disposal requirements
- What is considered sensitive or regulated data
- Appropriate or approved uses of data
- Access control and authorization
- Encryption needs

### Data mapping

### Data labeling

- Hard-copy materials
- Physical assets
- Digital files
- Some complex or shared systems and data sets

## 2.6 - Design and Implement Information Rights Management (IRM)

[Information rights management](../Definitions/I.md#information-rights-management-irm)
- Consumer-grade IRM (DRM)
- Enterprise-grade IRM

### Objectives

- Persistence
- Dynamic policy control
- Expiration
- Continuous audit trail
- Interopability

### Appropriate Tools

## 2.7 - Plan and Implement Data Retention, Deletion, and Archiving Policies

### Data Retention Policies

- Storage costs and access requirements
- Specified legal and regulatory retention periods
- Data retention practices
- Data security and discovery

Data retention practices include
- Schedules
- Integrity checking
- Retrieval procedure
- Data formats

### Data Deletion Procedures and Mechanisms

[NIST SP 800-88](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/88/r1/final), Guidelines for Media Sanitization is a widely available standard.
- Clear
- Purge
- Destroy

### Data Archiving Procedures and Mechanisms

### Legal Hold

[Legal Hold](../Definitions/L.md#legal-hold)

## 2.8 - Design and Implement Auditability, Traceability, and Accountability of Data Events

### Definition of Event Sources and Requirement of Event Attribution

- Synchronize time across all servers and devices
- Differing classification schemes
- Identity attribution
    - User identity
    - IP address
    - Geolocation
- Application specific logs
- Integrity of log files

### Logging, Storage, and Analysis of Data Events

- Log centralization and aggregation
- Data integrity
- Normalization
- Automated or continuous monitoring
- Alerting
- Investigative monitoring

### Chain of Custody and Nonrepudation

[Chain of custody](../Definitions/C.md#chain-of-custody)
