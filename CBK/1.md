# Domain 1: Cloud Concepts, Architecture and Design

## 1.1 - Understand Cloud Computing Concepts

### Cloud Computing Definitions

- [Capital expenditures](../Definitions/C.md#capital-expenditures-capex)
- [Operating expenditures](../Definitions/O.md#operating-expenitures-opex)

Three basic service models
- [Software as a service](../Definitions/S.md#software-as-a-service)
- [Platform as a service](../Definitions/P.md#platform-as-a-service-paas)
- [Infrastructure as a service](../Definitions/I.md#infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas)

Four cloud deployment models
- Public
- Private
- Hybrid
- Community

### Cloud Computing Roles and Responsibilities

Cloud service customer
> The person or company purchasing the cloud service.

Cloud service provider (CSP)
> The company or other entity offering the cloud services.

Cloud service partner
> A third party offering a variety of cloud based services, using the cloud service provider.

Cloud service broker
> A broker of cloud services. A broker is an individual or firm that acts as an intermediary between two parties.

The cloud shared responsibility model

| Responsibility                | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
|-------------------------------|------|------|------|
| Data classification           | C    | C    | C    |
| Identiy and Access Management | C    | C/P  | C/P  |
| Application security          | C    | C/P  | C/P  |
| Network security              | C/P  | P    | P    |
| Host infrastructure           | C/P  | P    | P    |
| Physical security             | P    | P    | P    |

## 1.3 - Understand Security Concepts Relevant to Cloud Computing

### Cryptography and Key Management

- [Cryptography](../Definitions/C.md#cryptography)

Some considerations.
- Where are the keys stored?
- Who generates and manages the keys?
- Should a key management service be used?

Different types of encryptions
- [Symmetric encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm)
- [Assymetric encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)

### Identity and Access Control

There are multiple types of access control.
- Physical access
- User access
- Privilege access
- Service access

### Data and Media Sanitization

Types of sanitization techniques include the following.
- Overwriting
- [Cryptographic erasure](../Definitions/C.md#cryptographic-erasure)

### Netowrk Security

- Network security groups
- [Zero trust](../Definitions/Z.md#zero-trust) network (formal definition can be found in [NIST SP 800-207](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/207/final))
- Ingress and egress monitoring

### Virtualization Security

- Hypervisor type 1 is generally faster and more secure but requires special skills to set up and maintain.
- Hypervisor type 2 run on top of a host operating system like Windows or macOS. These are easier to set up, typically requiring only the skills needed to install the virtualization application.
- [Virtual machine escape](../Definitions/V.md#virtual-machine-escape)

Other considerations
- Container security
- Ephemeral computing
- [Serverless technology](../Definitions/S.md#serverless-computing)
