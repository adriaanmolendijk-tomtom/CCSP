# Domain 4: Cloud Application Security

## 4.1 - Advocate Training and Awareness for Application Security

#### Cloud Development Basics

- Security by design
- Shared security responsibility
- Security as a business objective

#### Common Pitfalls

#### Common Cloud Vulnerabilities

- CSA top threats to cloud computing [https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/topics/top-threats/](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/topics/top-threats/)
- OWASP top 10 [https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- SANS CWE top 25 [https://www.sans.org/top25-software-errors/](https://www.sans.org/top25-software-errors/)

## 4.2 - Describe the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Process

- Microsoft security development lifecycle [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl)
- NIST secure software development framework [https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf)
- OWASP software assurance maturity model [https://owasp.org/www-project-samm/](https://owasp.org/www-project-samm/)

#### Business Requirements

#### Phases and Methodologies

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is generally made up as follows.
- Requirements
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- O&M

SDLC methodologies
- [Waterfall](../Definitions/W.md##waterfall)
- [Agile](../Definitions/A.md##agile)

## 4.3 - Apply the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

#### Cloud-specific Risks

Cloud security alliance top threats.

[Egregious 11](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/top-threats-egregious-11-deep-dive/).
- Data breaches
- Misconfigurations and inadequate change control
- Lack of cloud security architecture and strategy
- Insufficient identity, credential, access and key management
- Account hijacking
- Insider threat
- Insecure interfaces and APIs
- Weak control plane
- Metastructure and applistructure failures
- Limited cloud usage visibility
- Abuse and nefarious use of cloud services

#### Threat Modeling

- [STRIDE](../Definitions/S.md##stride)
- [DREAD](../Definitions/D.md##dread)
- PASTA
- ATASM

#### Avoid Common Vulnerabilities during Development

- Training and awareness
- Documented process
- Test driven development

#### Secure coding

- OWASP
- [ASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
- [SAFECode](https://safecode.org/)

#### Software Configuration Management and Versioning

## 4.4 - Apply Cloud Software Assurance and Validation

#### Functional and Non-Functional Testing

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Usability testing

#### Security Testing Methodologies

Test types
- White box
- Gray box
- Black box

Application testing
- [Static application security testing](../Definitions/S.md##static-application-security-testing-sast)
- [Dynamic appliccation security testing](../Definitions/D.md##dynamic-application-security-testing)
- Interactive application security testing (IAST)

Code review and manual testing

[Software composition analysis](../Definitions/S.md##software-composition-analysis-sca)

#### Quality Assurance

#### Abuse Case Testing

## 4.5 - Use Verified Secure Software

#### Secure Application Programming Interfaces

#### Supply Chain Management

#### Third-party Software Management

#### Validated Open-source Software

## 4.6 - Comprehend the Specifics of Cloud Application Architecture

#### Supplemental Security Components

- [Web application firewall](../Definitions/W.md##waterfall)
- [Database activity monitoring](../Definitions/D.md##database-activity-monitoring-dam)
- Extensible Markup Language Firewalls
- API gateways

#### Cryptography

- [Cryptography](../Definitions/C.md##cryptography)

#### Sandboxing

#### Application Virtualization and Orchestration

- Microservices
- Containerization

## 4.7 - Design Appropriate Identity and Access Management (IAM) Solutions
