# 1.1 - Understand Cloud Computing Concepts

## Cloud Computing Definitions

[Capital expenditure](../../../definitions/C.md#capital-expenditures-capex)

Operating expenitures (OpEx)

> An operating expense is an ongoing cost for running a product, business, or system.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense)

Three basic service models
- Software as a service (SaaS)
- Platform as a service (PaaS)
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

Four cloud deployment models
- Public
- Private
- Hybrid
- Community

## Cloud Computing Roles and Responsibilities

Cloud service customer
> The person or company purchasing the cloud service.

Cloud service provider
> The company or other entity offering the cloud services.

Cloud service partner
> A third party offering a variety of cloud based services, using the cloud service provider.

Cloud service broker
> A broker of cloud services. A broker is an individual or firm that acts as an intermediary between two parties.

The cloud shared responsibility model

| Responsibility                | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
|-------------------------------|------|------|------|
| Data classification           | C    | C    | C    |
| Identiy and Access Management | C    | C/P  | C/P  |
| Application security          | C    | C/P  | C/P  |
| Network security              | C/P  | P    | P    |
| Host infrastructure           | C/P  | P    | P    |
| Physical security             | P    | P    | P    |

## Key Cloud Computing Characteristics

NIST SP 800-145 definition of cloud computing.
- On demand self service
- Broad network access
- Multitenancy
- Rapid elasticity and scalability
- Resource pooling
- Measured service

## Building Block Technologies

Virtualization

> In computing, virtualization or virtualization (sometimes abbreviated v12n, a numeronym) is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something at the same abstraction level, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.
