# 1.1 - Understand Cloud Computing Concepts

## Cloud Computing Definitions

- [Capital expenditures](../../../definitions/C.md#capital-expenditures-capex)
- [Operating expenditures](../../../definitions/O.md#operating-expenitures-opex)

Three basic service models
- [Software as a service](../../../definitions/S.md#software-as-a-service)
- [Platform as a service](../../../definitions/P.md#platform-as-a-service-paas)
- [Infrastructure as a service](../../../definitions/I.md#infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas)

Four cloud deployment models
- Public
- Private
- Hybrid
- Community

## Cloud Computing Roles and Responsibilities

Cloud service customer
> The person or company purchasing the cloud service.

Cloud service provider (CSP)
> The company or other entity offering the cloud services.

Cloud service partner
> A third party offering a variety of cloud based services, using the cloud service provider.

Cloud service broker
> A broker of cloud services. A broker is an individual or firm that acts as an intermediary between two parties.

The cloud shared responsibility model

| Responsibility                | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
|-------------------------------|------|------|------|
| Data classification           | C    | C    | C    |
| Identiy and Access Management | C    | C/P  | C/P  |
| Application security          | C    | C/P  | C/P  |
| Network security              | C/P  | P    | P    |
| Host infrastructure           | C/P  | P    | P    |
| Physical security             | P    | P    | P    |

Best known CSPs
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- Microsoft Azure [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us).
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) [https://cloud.google.com/](https://cloud.google.com/).
