# 1.2 - Describe Cloud Reference Architecture

## Cloud Computing Activities

- Cloud consumer
- Cloud service provider

- Cloud carrier

## Cloud Service Capabilities

- Application capability types
- Platform capability types
- Infrastructure capability types

## Cloud Service Categories

- Software as a service
- Platform as a service
- Infrastructure as a service

## Cloud deployment models

- Public cloud
- Private cloud
- Community cloud
- Hybrid cloud
- Multi-cloud

## Cloud Shared Considerations

Interopability
> The ability to communicate with and share data across multiple platforms and between traditional IT and cloud services by different vendors.

Portability
> Data portability - the ability to move data between traditional and cloud services or between different cloud services without having to port the data using potentially lossy methods.
> Architecture portability - the ability to allow migration of applications or systems without significant changes to or loss of service.

Reversibility
> The measure to which, when an organization moves an application or workload into a CSP, it can be moved back out again.
> This reverse could be one from CSP to another, or back to an on-premises environment.

Availability
> Ensure availability of the application / system, often to meet defined SLAs.

Resiliency
> The ability to continue operating under adverse or unexpected conditions.

Other considerations
- Security
- Privacy
- Performance
- Governance
- Audibility
- Regulatory
- Outsourcing

## Impact of related technologies

Data science

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)

> Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy, structured, and unstructured data.

Machine learning

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

> Machine learning (ML) is an umbrella term for solving problems for which development of algorithms by human programmers would be cost-prohibitive, and instead the problems are solved by helping machines "discover" their "own" algorithms, without needing to be explicitly told what to do by any human-developed algorithms.

Artificial intelligence

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals. It is also the field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines.

Blockchain

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

> A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.

Internet of things

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)

> The Internet of things (IoT) describes devices with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.

Quantum computing

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing)

> A quantum computer is a computer that takes advantage of quantum mechanical phenomena.
> At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior, specifically quantum superposition and entanglement, using specialized hardware that supports the preparation and manipulation of quantum states.

Edge computing

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing)

> Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data.
> This is expected to improve response times and save bandwidth.

Confidential computing

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidential_computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidential_computing)

> Confidential computing is a security and privacy-enhancing computational technique focused on protecting data in use.
